# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE:** 13.06.2020
* **ASSISTANTS:** Marta Cortés Orduña

### Minutes

Probems in the wiki:
Our overview is not about "selling" our API, it should focus on those aspects.
Our main concepts and relations -part also needs some tuning...
API uses -part is "okay", also related work is "ok".

The main problem is, that there is not enough resources in our API.
We need to add more.

### Action points

Find some more resources to add to the API.
Fix the wiki.

## Meeting 2.
* **DATE:** 19.2.2020
* **ASSISTANTS:** Ivan Sanchez Milara (?)

### Minutes
Discussion about the database and API.

Why did we choose a number instead of nickname as unique?
-We maybe should change nickname to be unique string, instead of number
Change the month tables to just one, with month column?
-Date is an unique attribute then in the table?
Discussion about the changes, and what are needed...

Ivan checked our populated database.
Users and stuff are not populated yet.
Only the monthly tables.

We could use an excel file for example to populate the database instead of
using row by row -python fill. CSV.
Create a dictionary and call the .csv etc...

We need to populate the users and added articles too, 4-5 users...

Define what happens when user is deleted?
Check what happens if unique field is tried to add with same value?
That was already implemented in the tests...

Checked running the pytest from our repo.

### Action points
Change users to be identified with unique string.

Month-tables to just one table instead, with datetime or similar unique identifier.

Populate users and added articles, 4-5 examples.
Also in headlines-links a few examples is enough.
